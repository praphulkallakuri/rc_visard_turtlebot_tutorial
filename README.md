Visard4Ros turlebot demo application
====================================

This demo application showcases Roboception's [rc_visard](http://roboception.com/rc_visard)
in a mobile robot scenario utilizing turtlebot and rc_visard's on-board SLAM module to create
an octomap of the environment and autonomously navigate in it.

Details about running the demo can be found in the tutorial on the ROS wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/rc_visard/Tutorials
